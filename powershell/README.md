  PowerShell Core is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework.
description: |
  PowerShell is the default shell on Windows 10. Since `curl.exe | powershell` is effectively as convenient as `curl | bash` for users, and since Windows 10 also includes tar, curl.exe, and ssh, among others, you can use fairly simple PowerShell to make a variety of tasks simple for Windows developers.

<!--
For example, if you wanted to install Node.js with powershell and
webinstall.dev, you can:

```cmd
curl.exe -s -A "MS" https://webinstall.dev/node@lts | powershell
```
-->

<!-- TODO if, pipe, function -->
