### `brew` screwed up everything, now what?

Sometimes you're compelled against all reason to do something really stupid,
like `brew upgrade` or `brew update python`, and your whole system gets borked.

For _Mojave_, _Catalina_, _Big Sur_, and above:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall.sh)"
```

For _High Sierra_ and below:

```bash
/bin/bash -c ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```
